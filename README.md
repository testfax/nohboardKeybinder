# Useage
This tool is used to adjust keybinds for the Nohboard overlay.
Equip your favorite overlay and get it running.
Navigate to your faviorite overlay in the file explorer.
Grab the keybind.json file. Make sure you are NOT grabbing the one in the main directory. That is not the one that we want.
Import the 'keyboard.json' file into the website.
You will have a second option whether or not to import your Elite: Dangerous keybinds file. This will pair up all matching keys/mouse inputs and match them together.
-
The matched keybinds are a direct corelation of the keybinds file. 
For example, a thrust forward key of 'w' will match your game binds with every key that has 'w' and show you. You will only be able to select 1 key press per Noh ID. Which in this example is the 'thrust forward' overlay item.

# Joystick support
